#NEXT.JS BASICS
`It is not possible to build a full feature rich app for production using REACT bcz it is used for building UI. You also have to make decisions on other features of apps like authentication, routing, styling.
But Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. It uses a package that React use for building UI. It is loaded with so many features that simplifies the process of building a react app fo production. There is no need to install additional packages. Next.js provides everything.`
